## Customer Segmentation and Sales Pattern Analysis
📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an E-commerce dataset containing attributes like Sales, Quantity, Profit, Discount, and various categorical features (Segment, Ship Mode, Region, etc.).
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Clustering Techniques, we uncover trends, patterns, and relationships to offer actionable insights for improving marketing strategies, customer engagement, and profitability.

🛠️ Problem Statement
Analyze customer behavior and sales patterns to:

Segment customers based on purchasing behavior

Identify regional and product-based performance

Provide data-driven recommendations for business growth

📈 Methodology
Data Collection & Inspection

Acquired and cleaned e-commerce data (Sales, Quantity, Profit, Discount, etc.)

Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

Data Preprocessing

Imputation, outlier removal

Feature engineering (Customer Lifetime Value, Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

Feature Scaling

Standardized numerical features for better clustering results

Data Visualization

Univariate: Histograms, Box Plots, Bar Charts

Bivariate: Scatter plots, Correlation matrices

Multivariate: Heatmaps, 3D plots

Customer Segmentation

Applied K-Means Clustering

Used Elbow Method to find optimal clusters

Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization

🚀 Results
High-Value Customers: Identified prime targets for loyalty programs (Clusters 0 & 2)

At-Risk Customers: Low sales and profit (Clusters 1 & 3)

Frequent Shoppers: High quantity but low sales value buyers (Cluster 1)

Top Regions: California, New York, Texas

Top Products: Home-office segment (Staple-related products)

Preferred Shipping Mode: Standard Class

Best Sales Year: 2016

📊 Key Visualizations
Segment vs Profit Bar Charts

Top 10 States Revenue Bar Charts

Violin Plots showing data distributions

PCA Scatter plot for cluster visualization
