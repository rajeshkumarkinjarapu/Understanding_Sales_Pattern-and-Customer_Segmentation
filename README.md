# Customer Segmentation and Sales Pattern Analysis
## üìã Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an E-commerce dataset containing attributes like Sales, Quantity, Profit, Discount, and various categorical features (Segment, Ship Mode, Region, etc.).
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Clustering Techniques, we uncover trends, patterns, and relationships to offer actionable insights for improving marketing strategies, customer engagement, and profitability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement
Analyze customer behavior and sales patterns to:

‚û§Segment customers based on purchasing behavior

‚û§Identify regional and product-based performance

‚û§Provide data-driven recommendations for business growth

## üìà Methodology
‚û§Data Collection & Inspection

‚Ä¢Acquired and cleaned e-commerce data (Sales, Quantity, Profit, Discount, etc.)

‚Ä¢Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

‚û§Data Preprocessing

‚Ä¢Imputation, outlier removal

‚Ä¢Feature engineering (Customer Lifetime Value, Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

‚û§Feature Scaling

‚Ä¢Standardized numerical features for better clustering results

‚û§Data Visualization

‚Ä¢Univariate: Histograms, Box Plots, Bar Charts

‚Ä¢Bivariate: Scatter plots, Correlation matrices

‚Ä¢Multivariate: Heatmaps, 3D plots

‚û§Customer Segmentation

‚Ä¢Applied K-Means Clustering

‚Ä¢Used Elbow Method to find optimal clusters

‚Ä¢Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization

## üöÄ Results
‚Ä¢High-Value Customers: Identified prime targets for loyalty programs (Clusters 0 & 2)

‚Ä¢At-Risk Customers: Low sales and profit (Clusters 1 & 3)

‚Ä¢Frequent Shoppers: High quantity but low sales value buyers (Cluster 1)

‚Ä¢Top Regions: California, New York, Texas

‚Ä¢Top Products: Home-office segment (Staple-related products)

‚Ä¢Preferred Shipping Mode: Standard Class

‚Ä¢Best Sales Year: 2016

## üìä Key Visualizations
‚Ä¢Segment vs Profit Bar Charts

‚Ä¢Top 10 States Revenue Bar Charts

‚Ä¢Violin Plots showing data distributions

‚Ä¢PCA Scatter plot for cluster visualization

‚Ä¢Kernel Density Estimations for continuous variables

## üìù Conclusion
‚û§Identified four optimal customer clusters using K-Means and PCA.

‚û§Gained actionable insights into purchasing behavior and customer segmentation.

‚û§Insights can drive personalized marketing, better targeting, and optimized product offerings to boost business performance.
